## 🗓️ October 2025

### Week 1: Foundation Building

#### Day 1 - Saturday, October 26, 2025

**Hour 1: Arrays & Two Pointers** (11:49 PM IST)
- ✅ LeetCode #1: Two Sum (HashMap pattern)
- ✅ LeetCode #125: Valid Palindrome (Two Pointers)
- **Time:** 60 minutes
- **Learning:** HashMap converts O(n²) to O(n), Two Pointers for palindrome checks
- **Confidence:** 8/10

**Hour 2: Strings & HashMaps** (12:50 AM IST)
- ✅ LeetCode #242: Valid Anagram (Frequency counting)
- ✅ LeetCode #217: Contains Duplicate (Set for duplicates)
- ✅ LeetCode #49: Group Anagrams (Sorted string as key)
- **Time:** 60 minutes
- **Learning:** defaultdict simplifies grouping, sorted strings identify anagrams
- **Confidence:** 8/10

**Day Summary:**
- **Problems:** 5/5 (100% success)
- **Patterns:** HashMap, Two Pointers, Set, Sorted Keys
- **Hours:** 2
- **Notes:** Strong start. Asked good questions about set() and defaultdict. Deep understanding > speed.

#### Day 2 - Sunday, October 27, 2025

**Hour 3: Sliding Window** (4:49 PM IST)
- ✅ LeetCode #485: Max Consecutive Ones (Basic sliding window)
- ✅ LeetCode #121: Best Time to Buy/Sell Stock (Track minimum)
- ✅ LeetCode #3: Longest Substring Without Repeating (Window + Set)
- **Time:** ~3 hours (with detailed explanation request on #3)
- **Learning:** Sliding window = expand right, shrink left when invalid. Window + Set for O(1) duplicate checks.
- **Confidence:** 9/10
- **Challenge:** Almost skipped #3, but pushed through with Sarge's help. "Later" never comes—finish what you start!

**Day Summary:**
- **Problems:** 3/3 (100% success)
- **Patterns:** Sliding Window (3 variations)
- **Hours:** 1 (coding) + 2 (understanding)
- **Notes:** This is how you grow—don't skip hard problems. Get help, understand deeply, then conquer.

## 🎯 Next Steps

**Hour 4:** Mixed pattern practice (arrays + strings + sliding window)  
**Week 2:** Continue momentum, add new patterns (stacks, queues)  
**Month 1:** 60+ problems target  

**Goal:** 15-20 LPA role by December 2026  
**Strategy:** Depth over breadth, consistent 6 hours daily, master patterns not memorize solutions
